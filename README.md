## Trello Board with React

In this two-day sprint you will be building a Trello clone. [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a popular application for managing tasks and projects, often used in agile software development. We will probably use Trello in our own project later in the course so please sign up with Trello now and explore its functionality.

In this sprint, you should aim to implement an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), i.e, a basic prototype with core functionality which can be extended at a later date. A user should be able to create and delete lists, and add, update and delete cards from each list.


NB. This project uses webpack and also includes hot module replacement. As well as automatically reloading the page, this setup will persist the state of your application after reload. This will aid your development workflow.

### Objectives

1. To get more practice designing and building complex React applications.
2. To learn how to use a CSS framework.
3. To practice testing React components.
4. To carefully consider user interaction and to build an appealing user interface.


### Stages

1. As usual, spend some time thinking carefully about how you might solve this problem before you start. Think about what data you will need and what it will look like. Plan your components and layout on paper before you start.
2. Begin by creating the stateless components you need. Style them nicely with [Bulma](http://bulma.io/).
3. Add state into your application, hardcoding it initially.
4. One by one, add the user interaction features. Perhaps begin by adding create/update/delete features on a single list, and then think about allowing for extra lists to be added/deleted.

##### Bonus

Trello boards have lots of features - here are just a few ideas.

5. Add a button to allow a user to move a card up or down a list.
6. Allow a user to change the background color of the page.
7. Allow each list to have an updatable title.
8. Add a dropdown menu on the card to allow a user to move it from one list to another.
9. Allow a user to set a Due By date on each card. If the due date is in the past, visually signal that the card is overdue.
